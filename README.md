# GreaseMonkey

## About
* GreaseMonkey is a client and appointment management application intended for mechanics to keep track of upcoming service dates for their client's vehicles. 

## My Developer Role
* Created a database using Node.js and MongoDB as well as a client side through React:
* 1. Created controllers for CRUD with a promise based HTTP client. 
* 2. Used nodemailer to add function to contact clients and send messaged directly through application. 
* 3. Added database of DTCs with embedded video player with steps to address technical vehicle issues.
